# ** taSk **
_A self-destructing to-do list to keep you focused, motivated, and on taSk!_


taSk keeps your to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. If the taSk is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.
