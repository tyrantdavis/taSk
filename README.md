# **taSk**
_A self-destructing to-do list to keep you focused, motivated, and on taSk!_
---

taSk keeps your to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. If the taSk is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.
## Application Features:
* allow users to sign-up for a standard account 
* allow users to sign-in and sign-out
* allow users to create, edit, and delete to-do items
* automated rake scheduler using **whenever**  to delete items older than 7 days
___
## Setup 

#### Languages and Frameworks: 
* Ruby version 2.3.3
* Ruby on Rails 5.02
